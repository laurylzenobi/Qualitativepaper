**Introduction**
For the purpose of this paper, I will read Chung Ching Shiung's dissertation, which explores changes in ceramic assemblages in the Maluku region of Indonesia. A copy of his dissertation has been uploaded to the source folder on github.  

I have selected Shiung's dissertation over a previous choice (Kyle Latinis, UH Manoa), because of its focus on ceramics and its comprehensive nature, as it will be of direct influence on my own research. 

The goal of this exercise is to both delve into the existing literature on Maluku ceramic industries, and to explore Shiung's theoretical framewoks in the hope that it will inform my own interpretations. 

This dissertation, titled, "The Implications of Social, Cultural, Economic, and Political Interactions for Ceramic Evolution on the Banda Islands, Maluku Province, Indonesia", explores the relationships between external factors like culture contact and trade, and internal factors like changes to cultural material. The research goals of Shiung's dissertation are to determine:  
  >1) whether the external and internal factors affect >Banda’s material culture, particularly its ceramics,
	>2) how we can measure and monitor their influence on >Banda’s ceramic changes, and
	>3) the broader implications of ceramic changes in >connection with Banda’s cultural history." (Shiung 2011:6)

**Archaeological evidence**
Ceramic materials are the unit of analysis for this dissertation. Shiung argues that ceramic assemblages could be used to understand the social, political, and economic rationale of the people who produce and distribute the ceramics. Previous approaches, such as Bellwood's Austronesian expansion model has long been used to explain the movement and distribution of people and goods (utilitarian and trade) throughout Island Southeast Asia (ISEA). Ceramics remained largely unchanged for millenia in ISEA, however, the development of pan-regional trade with Chinese and Muslim traders during the past one thousand years may have altered this continuity. If that is true, then increased culture contact as a result of growing trade relationships could induce changes in local material culture. Shiung focuses particularly on the specialization of ceramic production in the Banda Islands in the context of a growing maritime spice trade during the last one thousand years in the Maluku region.

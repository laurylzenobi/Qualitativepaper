For the purpose of this paper, I will read Kyle Latinis' disseration, which provides a wealth of information related to the sago trade and ceramic analysis within the Maluku province of Indonesia. The dissertation is uploaded in multiple rtf files, therefore, I have linked to the url below:  

[Latinis Dissertation](https://catalyst.uw.edu/workspace/emilypt/22980/359384)  

The goal of this qualitative paper will be to both delve into the existing research that relates directly to my dissertation topic, and to determine the explanatory style that Latinis employs to interpret ceramic ovens, in the hope that his theoretical frameworks will inform my own.
